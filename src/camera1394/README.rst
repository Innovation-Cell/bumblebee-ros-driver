Overview
========

Camera1394_ is a ROS_ driver for devices supporting the IEEE 1394
Digital Camera (IIDC) protocol. It supports the ROS image_pipeline_,
using libdc1394_ for device access.

This package has no released code API.

**Warning**::

  The master branch normally contains code being tested for the next
  ROS release.  It will not always work with all previous releases.
  Sometimes, it may not work at all.

The current ``master`` branch works with Hydro and Indigo.  To build
for Fuerte or Groovy, check out the ``fuerte-devel`` or
``groovy-devel`` branch instead.
